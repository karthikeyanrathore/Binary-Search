Q. Given a maze , source , destination . find path. L R U D (left , right ,up , down).

0 = walls
1 = free

0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0  
1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1  
1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1  
1 1 1 0 1 1 0 1  
1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1  
1 1 1 1 1 0 1 1  
0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0  
1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1  
1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1  
0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0  

source = (0 , 2)
dest = (9 , 6)

shortest path in term of L R D U.

sol : docs/back.cpp
D R R R D D L D D D D D R R D

--------

FINAL
- I guess it works for every  testcases.
- ./run.sh (tiny 10x10 img) - https://imgur.com/a/dm3L0zi
- ./srun.sh (small 15x15 img) - https://imgur.com/a/q0Ui4Ne
- ./nrun.sh (normal 41x41 img) - https://imgur.com/a/hFjQyAD
- ./prun.sh (perfect4k 4001x4001 img) - 

As the images are 10x10 , 15x15 , 41x41 so to see the input image & output image.
- the images are not photoshoped. You can't view 10x10 image on any os(image viewer) , so i used photoshop to view it.

Issue
- saving every singlie pixel in docs/in1 , in2 , in3 // is not the right way.


Ignore
- git config credential.helper 'cache --timeout=243600'
