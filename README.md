### Search element in an array

Let us assume we have an array a = [a1 , a2 , a3 ...... an] , sorted in ascending order. a(i) <= a(i + 1) should be fulfilled for the neighboring elements of the array. Our target is to search for the position of the element x in the array , that is we need to find index(i) such that a(i) = x.
